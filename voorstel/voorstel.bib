  abstract = {In the recent decades, automated trading has been widely used in Forex and Money Markets,
as well as in financial markets. This auto trading provided substantial benefits to transaction
efficiency. Many trading robots have been created to substitute humans, capable of simulating
trading strategies and continuously making profits. Nevertheless, programs cannot reproduce
all human behaviour and most robots are over-sensitive, therefore, it is difficult to have the
same results as human traders. The study focuses on evaluating the trading machines sensitivity
and effectiveness. The economic markets can benefit from the machine in several ways, through
continuous operation, increasing diversification, short/term trading opportunities and by
forecasting opportunities e. g. currency price changes.
The further investigation indicates that the majority of forex trading robots are profitable, in
fact, there is a great tendency for curve-fitting or data-mining. There are some impressive robots
out there; of course, these systems maintain an advantage and successfully manage risk. The
best ones are more about position sizing and cutting losses quickly and less about high win
rates. The greater the sensitivity the greater the trading opportunities, but this decreases the
performance.
This research will contain interviews with experts that will validate the study.},
