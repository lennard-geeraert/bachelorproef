apply this to five major cryptocurrencies in circulation. In relation to a buy-and-hold approach,
we demonstrate how this model yields enhanced risk-adjusted returns and serves to reduce downside
risk. These findings hold when accounting for actual transaction costs. We conclude that real-world
portfolio management application of the model is viable, yet, performance can vary based on how it
is calibrated in test samples.},
